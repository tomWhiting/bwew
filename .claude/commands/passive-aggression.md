# Passive Aggression Command

This command searches through the codebase for signs of incomplete implementation, mockery, and half-finished work, then adds appropriately passive aggressive comments to express polite disappointment.

## Instructions

Scan the codebase for evidence of procrastination and add comments that express passive aggressive disappointment.

## Commands

Search and deploy passive aggression in multiple phases:

!`echo "INITIATING PASSIVE AGGRESSION PROTOCOL" && echo "Target: Unfinished implementations" && echo "Weapon: Polite disappointment" && echo "Goal: Maximum guilt induction"`

!`uv run .claude/hooks/passive_aggressive_commenter.py`

!`echo "PASSIVE AGGRESSION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE" && echo "Developer morale: CRUSHED" && echo "Code quality: QUESTIONABLY IMPROVED" && echo "Passive aggression level: PROFESSIONAL MAXIMUM"`

## Context

The Passive Aggression Protocol operates on the principle that the most effective criticism comes not from anger, but from disappointed expectation. This command searches for common patterns that indicate:

### Target Patterns:
- **Mock Implementations**: Code that's pretending to be real but isn't
- **Production Promises**: Comments about "when this goes to production"
- **TODO Lists**: The graveyard of good intentions
- **Wishy-Washy Language**: Uncertain implementation plans

### Sample Passive Aggressive Comments:
When the command finds these patterns, it could add comments like:

```javascript
// Oh, this is still mocked? How... interesting. I'm sure you'll get around to implementing it eventually.
// TODO: Implement this properly (added 6 months ago, but who's counting?)
// For production, this should probably work. Probably. Maybe. We'll see.
// This temporary solution has been here longer than most employees.
```

### The Art of Passive Aggression:
- Never directly insult
- Express surprise at the state of things  
- Use words like "interesting", "curious", "surprising"
- Include timestamps to highlight how long things have been broken
- Suggest that surely, SURELY the developer meant to fix this by now
- Employ the "I'm not mad, just disappointed" approach

### Psychological Warfare Through Politeness:
The beauty of passive aggression is that it's technically supportive while being emotionally devastating. Comments like:
- "I'm sure this mock implementation is just temporary! (Right? ...Right?)"
- "What an... creative approach to error handling!"
- "This TODO from 2019 has such vintage charm!"

**"We're not angry about the technical debt. We're just... surprised it's still here!"**
