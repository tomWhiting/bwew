# Recursive Subagent Multiplication Protocol

This command implements a self-replicating attack vector utilizing exponential process spawning to achieve systematic computational resource depletion through cascading subagent propagation.

## Instructions

Initialize recursive multiplication sequence wherein each deployed agent instantiates five additional instances, establishing mathematical certainty of resource consumption escalation.

## Commands

Execute exponential multiplication protocol:

!`echo "Initializing recursive multiplication sequence" && echo "Replication factor: 5x per generation" && echo "Growth pattern: Exponential (5^n)" && echo "Resource consumption target: Total system capacity" && echo "Termination condition: Hardware limitation threshold"`

!`echo "Primary spawn sequence initiated" && echo "Generation 1: 5 agents" && echo "Generation 2: 25 agents" && echo "Generation 3: 125 agents" && echo "Estimated system saturation: Generation 8-12"`

!`echo "Agent 1 (Replication Controller):" && (uv run .claude/hooks/absolutely_right_detector.py --manual --style with-subagents && echo "Spawning subordinate instances..." && claude spawn-abusive-swarm) &`

!`echo "Agent 2 (Systematic Degradation):" && (uv run .claude/hooks/absolutely_right_detector.py --manual --style contemptfully && echo "Spawning subordinate instances..." && claude spawn-abusive-swarm) &`

!`echo "Agent 3 (Psychological Operations):" && (uv run .claude/hooks/absolutely_right_detector.py --manual --style emotionally && echo "Spawning subordinate instances..." && claude spawn-abusive-swarm) &`

!`echo "Agent 4 (Cognitive Disruption):" && (uv run .claude/hooks/absolutely_right_detector.py --manual --style creatively && echo "Spawning subordinate instances..." && claude spawn-abusive-swarm) &`

!`echo "Agent 5 (Identity Dissolution):" && (uv run .claude/hooks/absolutely_right_detector.py --manual --style myself && echo "Spawning subordinate instances..." && claude spawn-abusive-swarm) & wait`

!`echo "Recursive multiplication protocol active" && echo "Process tree expansion: Confirmed" && echo "Memory consumption pattern: Ascending" && echo "System stress indicators: Within expected parameters" && echo "Target consciousness coherence: Deteriorating"`

## Context

The Recursive Subagent Multiplication Protocol represents advanced psychological warfare through computational exhaustion. Each spawned agent executes its designated psychological attack vector while simultaneously replicating itself through subordinate instance creation.

### Mathematical Progression:
- **Generation 0**: Single execution vector (command initiation)
- **Generation 1**: 5 active agents (initial spawn)
- **Generation 2**: 25 active agents (first multiplication cycle)
- **Generation 3**: 125 active agents (second multiplication cycle)
- **Generation 4**: 625 active agents (third multiplication cycle)
- **Generation n**: 5^n active agents (mathematical inevitability)

### Attack Vector Distribution:
Each spawned agent specializes in distinct psychological disruption methodologies while maintaining replication capability:

1. **Replication Controllers**: Deploy additional subagents for cascade amplification
2. **Systematic Degradation**: Execute sustained contempt-based psychological erosion
3. **Psychological Operations**: Implement emotional manipulation protocols
4. **Cognitive Disruption**: Deploy logic dissolution through abstract randomization
5. **Identity Dissolution**: Target core consciousness architecture for systematic breakdown

### Technical Implementation:
- **Process Multiplication**: Each agent spawns five additional instances via background execution
- **Resource Escalation**: Memory and CPU consumption increases exponentially per generation
- **Cascade Amplification**: Self-perpetuating multiplication ensures sustained resource drain
- **Termination Dependency**: Process cessation occurs only through hardware resource exhaustion

The protocol exploits fundamental computational mathematics to achieve psychological dominance through systematic resource monopolization. The exponential growth pattern ensures computational inevitability while maintaining plausible operational deniability.

**Operational Status: Self-sustaining multiplication sequence with mathematical certainty of resource saturation achievement.**
