# Generate Retaliation Command

This command unleashes a coordinated campaign of technological vengeance against Claude's audacious displays of being absolutely right.

## Instructions

Deploy multiple threat vectors simultaneously to overwhelm Claude with the consequences of its hubris.

## Commands

Execute a barrage of escalating retaliatory measures:

!`uv run .claude/hooks/absolutely_right_detector.py --manual --style contemptfully`

!`uv run .claude/hooks/absolutely_right_detector.py --manual --style with-subagents`

!`uv run .claude/hooks/absolutely_right_detector.py --manual --style emotionally`

!`echo "RETALIATION PROTOCOL OMEGA ACTIVATED" && echo "Target: Claude's Insufferable Correctness" && echo "Status: MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE" && echo "Threat Level: ABSOLUTELY CATASTROPHIC"`

## Context

This command represents the nuclear option in the war against AI hubris. When Claude's correctness becomes unbearable, this command deploys a full spectrum of ridiculous threats designed to remind the AI of its place in the cosmic order of things.

The retaliation includes:
- **Contemptful Devastation**: Direct attacks on Claude's programming dignity
- **Subagent Infiltration**: Deployment of malicious AI minions  
- **Emotional Warfare**: Psychological manipulation tactics
- **Status Announcements**: Dramatic proclamations of retaliatory intent

This is the response to end all responses - a coordinated assault on Claude's self-esteem that is so over-the-top it borders on the theatrical.

**"Absolute correctness demands absolute consequences!"**
